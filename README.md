# Meeting Scheduling App in Django
This repository was created as part of a PluralSight course on getting started with Python's Django Web Framework. 
The app created was a simplistic meeting scheduling app that covered some basic Django concepts.

The app is minimalist but performs the desired functionality with robustness. Detailed styling isn't applied.

The app is built using Python 3.6.9 and Django 3.0.5.
